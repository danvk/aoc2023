# Advent of Code 2023

This time in Zig?

I know about Zig because of Bun. Zig seems fast, I think it's a C (rather than C++) replacement.

Following:
https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/
https://ziglearn.org/

Install with homebrew:

    brew install zig

This puts me on Zig 0.11.

VS Code integration requires an extension. I got errors about not being able to find zig or zls in my PATH. I wound up installing it via the VS Code extension.

The thing about types being values looks interesting and kinda crazy.
